<p>With all the excitment coming up as we get ready to announce our first guests next week, we wanted to take the time to tell you about why we're so excited to be having LouisiANIME at the Ramada Lafayette Conference center. There are a lot of benefits that we feel that all of our attendees will greatly enjoy.</p>

<p>For everyone who is traveling from out of town, you'll find that the location is one of the most convenient in all of Lafayette. The Ramada is located right at the corner of I-10 & I-49, and is easily accessible from <i>all</i> directions, helping you cut back on driving time and traffic into the city. And more importantly, it means more time for you to spend having a great time at all of your favorite panels and our wonderful guests and all around enjoying your time with us.</p>

<p>The park grounds around the hotel are absolutely gorgeous, and we know how important it is to have a great place to take a cosplay picture at. You'll enjoy a calm and beautiful outdoor setting in the spacious grounds surrounding the facilities.</p>

<p>And speaking of the facilities, you will enjoy the use of the indoor swimming pool and hot tub, ensuring that you can have a blast swimming in your down time between panels no matter what the weather is like outside. You'll also have access to the indoor arcade and the Ramada's Bistro du Cayenne's, with traditional Cajun and Creole dishes.</p>

<p>The Ramada Lafayette Conference center is also a pet friendly hotel. For a 30$ fee you'll be able to bring your whole family, even the dog. And for those of you who get an interior facing room, your room will open up right into the active and bustling convention so that you can go straight to having fun without waiting for an elevator.</p>

<p>The friendly and helpful staff will help make this already incredible event space into the best LouisiANIME so far. We are really looking forward to seeing all of you for LouisiANIME 2015. So go ahead and get your pre-registration passes and call up the hotel and reserve your rooms!
