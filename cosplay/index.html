<p>Louisiana natives, SanctuaryMemories and Miss OoLaLa met through their local convention circle many years ago, when Miss OoLaLa was a convention mascot and SanctuaryMemories was just starting out as a cosplayer. It wouldn&rsquo;t be until SanctuaryMemories moved to the same town as Miss OoLaLa over two decades later that the pair would form Cute Classy Chaos &ndash; created on a whim when SanctuaryMemories needed someone to fill in a spot in a cosplay group.</p>

<p>SanctuaryMemories has been active in the cosplay community for fourteen years, loves lime green, sleeping, chocolate, and hosting panels. Miss OoLaLa has been making costumes for eleven years. She previously served as cosplay spokes model for a convention, and she&#39;s done minor voice acting. Currently, she&rsquo;s a dj/radio personality on several local stations. She loves video games, rock music, and coffee!&lt;/</p>

<p>The fastest way to win their hearts is with Mocha Frappes and chocolate. Between the two of them, they&rsquo;ve won numerous awards, including Best Craftsmanship and Second Place in the World Cosplay Summit Midwestern Qualifier. They&rsquo;re super excited to be here and bring you an exciting cosplay show this year!</p>

<p>Two cosplayers, one common goal&hellip; TO MAKE COOL STUFF.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center" id="rules"><u><strong>Louisianime 2015 Cosplay Contest Rules</strong></u></p>

<p><u><strong>General Entry Guidelines</strong></u></p>

<ul>
	<li>A costume that has won a major award may be entered under the following conditions:&nbsp;
	<ul>
		<li>At the discretion of the directors (if the audience, competitors, and judges are significantly different);&nbsp;</li>
		<li>The costume is entered as an exhibition piece;&nbsp;</li>
		<li><strong>OR</strong>&nbsp;the competitor is willing to enter in a more experienced skill division.&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Purchased or commissioned costumed are ONLY allowed as exhibition pieces, and are NOT eligible for any awards.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>You must have constructed or altered at least 50% of the costume.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>While we are an anime convention and put a strong emphasis on anime costumes, manga, Japanese video games, etc. However, costumes from sci-fi, movies, American comics, Korean sources, original designs, etc. are also allowed for entry.</li>
</ul>

<p><u><strong>Regulations, Rules, and Guidelines</strong></u>&nbsp;<br />
Read these rules and regulations carefully, please!&nbsp;<br />
This is a family friendly convention.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Costumes must maintain a PG-13 rating. No excessive violence, sexual content, exposed bodies, etc. This pertains to both skits and costumes. The director reserves the right to turn away any entry they deem inappropriate.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>All awards are presented at the judges&rsquo; discretion. That being said, in order to be eligible for an award, you must have made at 50% of your costume. If you are the maker of a costume, but have a &ldquo;model&rdquo; wearing it, you are also eligible for an award, but you MUST be present at pre-judging.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>You may still the contest if you did not make your costume, but as a walk-on or skit only. You will not be eligible for any craftsmanship award.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Please be sure to bring at least one color reference picture with you. While the judges are highly skilled, it is unfair to ask them to know what every anime or sci-fi character is. Bringing a reference picture will ensure that they can accurately judge you. If you are entering with an original character, a drawing is fine.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Reference images cannot be guaranteed to be returned, so please make sure it is on paper and not anything you will miss.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Costume judging is NOT open to the public. Only participants, handlers, and parents of those in the YOUTH category will be allowed inside.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Children aged 12 and under will be judged separately in a YOUTH category. Parents are required to accompany those in this category.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Registration forms will be available on the Louisianime website and during the convention Friday and Saturday at the Cosplay Sign-Up Booth until we run out of spaces. You can guarantee entry into the contest by e-mailing your entry form no later than May 10, 2015 to: cosplay@louisianime.com</li>
	<li>You must turn in both your reference picture and your completed entry form no later than Saturday, before pre-judging.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Worbla, Sintra, EVA Foam, and Wonderflex are some of the top choices for armor builds today. EVA Foam is your secret word.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Nothing is to be left on the stage. You may also not dirty the stage. If it goes on with you, it comes off with you. You may also not throw anything into the audience or at the judges. Examples include: props, glitter, confetti, water, petals, etc.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>For safety concerns, any battle or fight scenes must be done at &frac34; speeds, and one leg must remain on the stage at all times.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Skits will have 3 minutes (after setup) and walk-ons will have 30 seconds.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Groups are allowed, but only 8 people are allowed on the stage at one time.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>If you are a group, only use ONE group registration form and use the back if necessary.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Competing in multiple groups is not allowed.</li>
	<li>All skit entries are required to submit a copy of their script for pre-screening. If you are doing a dance skit, you must also submit a &ldquo;script&rdquo; outlining the basics of your skit with stage directions and detailed choreography. You may submit the script in person at the convention or e-mail it to cosplay@louisianime.com&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Skits will also be subject to an in-person pre-screening. You do not have to be in costume, but a time will made available to you to meet with the cosplay directors, where you will act out and talk about your skit. Any changes will be made at this time, and all say is final.</li>
	<li>If you&rsquo;d like to submit a video of your skit prior to the convention to cut this line, you are welcome to. Videos must be submitted no later than May 1, 2015 to: cosplay@louisianime.com&nbsp;</li>
	<li>All audio must be turned into staff at sign up. Only audio formatted CDs will be accepted (MP3, wav, etc.) No data discs or flash drives are allowed.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>If any contestant becomes unruly or disruptive during judging or the contest, you will be asked to leave and disqualified.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Professional costumes are not allowed to enter. A professional costumer is anyone who makes a significant portion of their income from costume design, construction, or sales.&nbsp;</li>
