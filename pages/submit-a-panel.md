We've closed our Panel Submission form while we finalize our schedule for this year's LouisiANIME. We are very grateful to everyone who submitted a request to host panels this year, your contributions help make this event fun and educational for everyone. We're excited to see you all there and can't wait to have a wonderful event this year! We'll be announcing on Facebook when we re-open panel submissions for 2016. We hope to be accepting them very shortly after announcing our 2016 dates.
