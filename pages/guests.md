Clifford is a newbie in the anime voice over world with his breakout role being Keita Tsuwabuki
in Good Luck Girl! Binbogami­Ga! Since then, Clifford has gone on to voice roles across the
many anime worlds, including Kaito Yashio in third installment of the Science Adventure series
Robotics;Notes and most recently Conny Springer in Attack on Titan! Outside of his voice
acting work, Clifford spends his time gaming and telling (really bad) jokes on the internet! He's

<h3>Felecia Angelle</h3>

Felecia Angelle is a voice actress in Dallas, TX by way of Lafayette, LA. Her hobbies include
reading, playing videogames (poorly), and trying really hard to get someone else to write her
bio. You can hear her voice all up in your anime, as well as coming through the TV to sell
toys to your kids. Felecia loves character work almost as much as she loves eating too much
pizza and taking naps. Her recent work includes Coco in “Fairy Tail”, Mero in “Sankarea”,
Sakura in “Evangelion 3.0′′, and Raynare/Yuma in “High School DXD”.
