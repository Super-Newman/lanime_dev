##Steampunk Soiree
Come join us again for our annual Steampunk Soiree.  Every year we do things a little bit differently, and this year is no exception.  The Soiree consists of a combination of steampunk related instructional programming followed by a dance with thematically appropriate music.  The Soiree is welcome to all, not just those in Steampunk attire.

##Game Show Desu… Ne?
We’re back again with our (in)famous Game Show, where attendees are chosen to compete against each other on stage in front of their friends and family!  The tasks will be ridiculous, and the dialogue will be hilarious.  The winner takes home a prize, and the losers take home their disappointment… and consolation prizes.  Contestants face off in several elimination rounds until the final round, an amazing obstacle course that runs throughout the room!

##VIP Lounge
A special Lounge area will be available for our VIP members.  This is a secluded room that will be a great place to relax or socialize with fellow VIPs.  The room itself will have its own schedule, so members will know when to show up so they can mingle with their favorite guests, or play games, or catch a movie.  There will even be themed blocks of time, such as Steampunk, Anime, Gaming, and more.

##Zombie Tag!
A recurring event is our popular Zombie Tag.  A variety of game types allow players to use foam dart guns to fend off invading zombie hordes.  Different game types include survival mode, last man standing, and rescue mode.  There is also a tournament with a prize at the end.

##Cosplay Contest
Have an awesome costume that you want to show off on stage?  Have the desire to prove your skills while pitted against your peers?  Want to watch others do just that?  Then the cosplay contest is for you.  Contestants show off the costumes they've made on stage for the audience, in hopes of taking home that coveted best in show award.
