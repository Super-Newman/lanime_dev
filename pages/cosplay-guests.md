		<h3><a href="https://www.facebook.com/MissMarquin">Miss Marquin</a></h3>
		<p>Miss Marquin is a southern cosplayer with tons of attitude. She went to her first anime convention when she was ten, but thought Cosplay was weird. A decade later, she did it on a whim (and blackmail from her best friend) and decided that it was a blast. Since then, she’s been busting out costumes at a dizzying pace and loves to compete. After Seven years of cosplaying, she’s taken home several awards, including a 3rd place Best in Show. She’s well-known in the community for busting out cosplays in the speed of light and gravitates towards cosplays with lots of intricate details—the harder the better! She is slowly edging her way into the cosplay world, and can’t wait to see what the future brings!</p>

		<h3><a href="https://www.facebook.com/SparklePipsi">Sparkle Pipsi</a></h3>
		Hailing from sunny Southern California, Sparkle Pipsi is a veteran cosplayer with over 10 years of experience creating and modeling costumes; she particularly loves dressing up as idols and magical girls! Always on the lookout for a new technical challenge, she has skills in sewing, prop and armor making, wig styling, and electronics. Pipsi has taken home several Master-class awards for her craftsmanship and presentations, both as an individual and as part of a group. As a panelist, she is excited to share her knowledge as a costume-maker with the attendees of Louisianime!
