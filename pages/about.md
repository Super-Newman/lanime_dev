Louisianime started May 8-10 of 2009, with an attendance of 865 people, at the Baton Rouge Marriott. Being on Mother’s day weekend, we quickly established ourselves as having a family friendly atmosphere, and did much in future years to encourage the entire family to come out to our event. Following that year, the company was purchased by it’s Vice Chairman, and as a result, dates for 2010 were pushed back to September 10-12, and the event was moved across the highway to the Crowne Plaza Baton Rouge. Even with these factors, Louisianime grew immensely, to 1300 attendees, a 50% growth! Because of this success, Louisianime chose to stay at it’s location for 2011, but moved back into the spring, as it had promised from the moment it began promoting under new ownership in 2010. Louisianime 2011 occurred on Easter Weekend, April 22-24, with various Easter related programming, including an Easter egg hunt and produced a comfortable growth up to 1450 people. Unfortunately, scheduling conflicts in the exceptionally busy spring of 2012 resulted in Louisianime having to depart from it’s beloved hometown in order to maintain a comfortable timeslot in a venue large enough to support them.

The Hilton Lafayette had hosted Mechacon in years past and was eager to work with us, as the entire staff was quite excited to hear that we would be bringing another convention into town. Louisianime is looking forward to this exciting change, and would like you all to join us.
