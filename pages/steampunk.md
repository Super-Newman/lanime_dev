LouisiANIME has a specially designated set of Artist Alley tables just for artists who cater to the Steampunk Style.  Dubbed “The Docks” all the various crews can show off their goods.  Reservation includes a table and a designated booth space for the artist to set up in, as well as a membership. We’ll be opening up registration for Steampunk Alley simultaneously with Artist Alley.
