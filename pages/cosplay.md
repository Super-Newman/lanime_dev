<h1>LouisiANIME Cosplay Contest</h1>

<p>Louisiana natives, SanctuaryMemories and Miss OoLaLa met through their local convention circle many years ago, when Miss OoLaLa was a convention mascot and SanctuaryMemories was just starting out as a cosplayer. It wouldn’t be until SanctuaryMemories moved to the same town as Miss OoLaLa over two decades later that the pair would form Cute Classy Chaos – created on a whim when SanctuaryMemories needed someone to fill in a spot in a cosplay group. </p>

<p>SanctuaryMemories has been active in the cosplay community for fourteen years, loves lime green, sleeping, chocolate, and hosting panels. Miss OoLaLa has been making costumes for eleven years. She previously served as cosplay spokes model for a convention, and she's done minor voice acting. Currently, she’s a dj/radio personality on several local stations. She loves video games, rock music, and coffee!</p>

<p>The fastest way to win their hearts is with Mocha Frappes and chocolate. Between the two of them, they’ve won numerous awards, including Best Craftsmanship and Second Place in the World Cosplay Summit Midwestern Qualifier. They’re super excited to be here and bring you an exciting cosplay show this year!</p>

<p>Two cosplayers, one common goal… TO MAKE COOL STUFF.</p>
