LouisiANIME loves to show off the creative side of our members, and that’s what the Artist Alley is for.  If you create your own crafts or art, you can sell it at LouisiANIME if you reserve a space with us.  All spaces come with a table to present your work upon, and a membership. We’ll be opening up registration for this very shortly.
